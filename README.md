# Hospital-Website
Website link: https://cashospital.netlify.app/
This is a sample website done using  HTML5,CSS and JavaScript .
HTML5 is used here to design the elemts in the website like paragraphs, images, scrollbars , links etc.
CSS is used  here to style all HTML elements.
I used CSS Flexbox for creating flexible boxes in website.
In this website it has an appointmnet form which can be filled by patients for getting appointment to a particular doctor in hospital.
